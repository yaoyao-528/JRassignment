# CareerMate AI
CareerMate AI is a concept prototype for an AI-powered career practice partner that helps students and early-career professionals strengthen resumes, rehearse interviews, build career habits, and showcase projects. This repository currently hosts the marketing landing page and related assets.

## Contents
- `index.html` – Landing page markup showcasing the value proposition and feature set.
- `styles.css` – Visual design and layout for the landing page sections.
- `script.js` – Placeholder for future interactive behaviors (e.g., form validation).
- `PRD.md` – Product Requirements Document outlining objectives, scope, personas, requirements, and release plan.

## Feature Highlights (as shown on the landing page)
- Hero section describing CareerMate AI’s mission.
- Problem/solution framing with visual storytelling.
- Feature grid covering AI mock interviews, resume analysis, habit coaching, and project resume builder.
- Demo walkthrough, technology stack highlights, testimonials, contact form, and CTA.

## Development Notes
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to view the static experience.
2. Update `styles.css` for layout/theme changes.
3. Extend `script.js` to add interactivity (form validation, animations, etc.).

## Product Documentation
The full PRD lives in `PRD.md`. Use it to align stakeholders on goals, requirements, and roadmap before expanding the prototype into a full application.
